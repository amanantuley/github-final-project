### ✅ **Formula**

$$
\text{Simple Interest (SI)} = \frac{P \times T \times R}{100}
$$

Where:

* **P** = Principal amount
* **T** = Time period in years
* **R** = Annual rate of interest

---

### ✅ **Input**

* `p` → Principal amount
* `t` → Time period in years
* `r` → Annual rate of interest

---

### ✅ **Output**

* **Simple Interest = (p × t × r) / 100**

---

### ✅ **Example**

```
Input:
P = 1000
T = 2
R = 5
