# **Simple Interest Calculator**

A calculator that calculates **Simple Interest** given **principal**, **annual rate of interest**, and **time period in years**.

---

### âœ… **Formula**

$$
\text{Simple Interest (SI)} = \frac{P \times T \times R}{100}
$$

Where:

* **P** = Principal amount
* **T** = Time period in years
* **R** = Annual rate of interest

---

### âœ… **Input**

* `p` â†’ Principal amount
* `t` â†’ Time period in years
* `r` â†’ Annual rate of interest

---

### âœ… **Output**

* **Simple Interest = (p Ã— t Ã— r) / 100**

---

### âœ… **Example**

```
Input:
P = 1000
T = 2
R = 5

Output:
Simple Interest = 100.0
```

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to **also include a Python code snippet for this calculator in the README** and a **badge for GitHub (like Python version, License)**? Or keep it minimal?
